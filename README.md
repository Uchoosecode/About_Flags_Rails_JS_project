# About_Flags_Rails_JS_project

Flags are national symbols. Every country has a specific flag as their national symbol. The
first flags were flown in the 18th century to tell others "we own this land and rule over the
people that live on it.

This app gives information on the different flags in the world today. You can add a fun fact, about
a country of flag if you'd like.

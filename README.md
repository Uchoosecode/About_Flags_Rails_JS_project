# About_Flags_Rails_JS_project

Flags are national symbols. Every country has a specific flag as their national symbol. The
first flags were flown in the 18th century to tell others "we own this land and rule over the
people that live on it.

This app gives the option to create your on Flag.... or will in the future. Right now its functioning enough to meet the requirements of this project.  You can add a Square, Triangle, Circle or a Rectangle of the entire canvas with the option of colors to add. You can name your flag and add a description about your flag.
